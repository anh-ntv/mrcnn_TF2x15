# MASK-RCNN model with Tensorflow-2.15

The [mrcnn_TF2x15](https://github.com/anh-ntv/mrcnn_TF2x15) project edits the original [Mask_RCNN/mrcnn](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/tree/master/mrcnn) project, which only supports TensorFlow 1.x and TensorFlow 2.0. 
This project can run on the Colab environment with:
- Tensorflow=2.15.0
- Scikit-image=0.16.2
